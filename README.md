# GLKolab

This is a final project for Computer Graphic class which I am taking today as an undergraduate student of Computer Science on Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, Surabaya, Indonesia. 

GLKolab is OpenGL Based 2D Whiteboard Collaboration. This is socket server-client based program which one server serve as an host for an whiteboard for its client. Very simple but useful although I would not use this _piece of crap_ for my entire life :D

Basic feature :
  * Primitive Object (Line and Arc)
  * Polygon
  * Text
  * Network Support
  * Object and vertex editing

## How to Use

  * Running server : `./server.py <port-number>`
  * Running client : `./glkolab.py <server-ip> <server-port-number> <some-random-name>`
